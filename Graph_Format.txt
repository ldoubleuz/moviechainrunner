A graph representing the movie titles are as follows:

Every title corresponds to one vertex. There is an edge from vertex u to
vertex v if the word corresponding to v overlaps with the word 
corresponding to u, and the weight is the number of new words added by
overlapping the two words. For example, for u = "Dawn of the Dead" and
v = "Dead Man Walking", there is an edge with weight 2 from u to v.
 
The vertices on a graph should be 0 index numbers. The mapping from ints
to titles should be handled outside of the graph representation.
 
Additionally, on a graph with titles n (on vertices 0...(n-1)), there must
be a vertex number n not corresponding to any particular title. Vertrex n
should have edges to each vertex, where the weight of the edge to a vertex
is the number of words in the title corresponding to the destination vertex.


The serialized format for a graph is:

The first two bytes specify the number of vertices. Theose bytes are
followed by a list of vertices specified as such:
The first two bytes specify the index of the edge. The second two bytes
specify the number of out edges in the graph. The rest of the line
consists of 4*n bytes, where n is the number of out edges. In each group
of 4 bytes, the first two are the vertex the edge goes to and the second
two are the weight of the edge. All numbers should be little endian.

Put no bytes between vertices.
